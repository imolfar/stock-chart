== README

This app could be strictly separated into front-end (AngularJS app) and back-end API (rails), but I intentionally made
home page generation on server-side so you can see that I know how to do it : )
Also I've included bower_components folder into git, so no need to install, though in real-world application it would
have only package.json file from which one have to run bower install.


- rake db:migrate
- To populate the database with bootstrap data run: rake db:seed
